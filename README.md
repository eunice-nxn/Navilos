### Navilos

[Navilos Source From Here](https://github.com/navilera/Navilos)

Navilos is the Real Time Operating System for embedded software development project.
I studied [Embedded OS Development Project](http://www.kyobobook.co.kr/product/detailViewKor.laf?mallGb=KOR&ejkGb=KOR&barcode=9788966262540&orderClick=JAj).
This repository contains the source codes of the Navilos.
For the exapanding the understanding of the operating system and ARM, I typed the code manually and executed it on the QEMU emulator 
used as a virtual machine for x86 or ARM.
